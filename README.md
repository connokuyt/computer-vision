# Mixed Kinematics and Camera Based Vehicle Dynamic Sideslip Estimation for an RC Scaled Model

The purpose of this algorithm is to track features in images coming from a small vehicle camera.
The algorithm, implemented exploiting OpenCV, consists of the following stages:

- image acquisition and correction
- feature detection and tracking
- projection and egomotion estimation
